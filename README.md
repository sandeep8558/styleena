## Image Overlay

Sometimes it is essential to use Overlay for images, here is how to use this approach.

- We always have to use overlay div before image
- image-overlay div has 100% width and 100% height
- you have to place you content inside of image-overlay div.
- image-overlay has no default opacity given
- you can give opacity directly to image-overlay

```bash
  <div class="image image-cover image-s">
    <div class="image-overlay"></div>
    <img src="" />
  </div>
```
